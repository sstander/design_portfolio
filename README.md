# My Design Portfolio

All of these projects were created at Utah Tech University between Fall 2014 and Spring 2015.

The Canterbury Dental website is no longer hosted because the dentist has retired. To view the website, open index.html. I designed this website completely from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The Logo Design Process shows how I came up with a fake logo starting from a lot of concepts to a few drafts and to the final result. It was created using Adobe Illustrator.

The Restaurant Menu was created for Bombay Cafe. I decided to redesign their menu because when I tried to find their menu online I could only find a white page with some text on it and it was not designed at all. I created a version that could be used in their restaurant using Adobe InDesign.

White Fang is one of my favorite books, which I why I chose to design a layout for it. One cool thing I did was make the chapter headings so the moon goes from new to full and back to new again. I used Adobe InDesign to create it. The picture of the wolf on the cover is not mine, and the words are from Jack London.
