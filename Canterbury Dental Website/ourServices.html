									<h3>Preventive Dentistry</h3>
									<div>
										<p>
											Preventive dentistry is the practice of caring for one's teeth to keep them healthy. This helps to avoid cavities, gum disease, enamel wear, and more.

									<h3>Comprehensive Oral Examination</h3>
									<p>
										A comprehensive exam is a thorough exam determining the health of your teeth, gums, and jaw joint. This exam also includes an oral cancer screening, recording of any previous dental work, and usually a complete set of dental x-rays. This comprehensive exam is reserved for patients that are new to our dental practice and patients of record that have been absent from treatment for more than 3 years.
									</p>
								</div>
							</li>
							<li>
								<div class="secondaryServices">
									<h3>Teeth Cleaning</h3>
									<p>

										Don't you love that nice polished feel of clean teeth? We offer the latest technology for fast, efficient, and painless cleanings.

										For those with more advanced gum infection (periodontal disease), we may use ultrasonic therapy, Rx mouth rinses, topical antibiotic treatment, and oral antibiotics.

										We make every effort to make your teeth clean and the surrounding tissue healthy with personalized treatment plans to suit your needs.
									</p>
								</div>
							</li>
							<li>
								<div class="secondaryServices">
									<h3>X-rays Examination</h3>
									<p>
										Dental X-rays are images of your teeth that your dentist uses to evaluate your oral health. These X-rays involve using low levels of radiation to capture images of the interior of your teeth and gums. This can help your dentist spot problems, such as cavities, tooth decay, and impacted teeth.
									</p>
								</div>
							</li>
							<li>
								<div class="secondaryServices">
									<h3>Gum Tissue Examination</h3>
									<p>
										A periodontal examination and probing are used to assess the health of your gums and teeth. They can help your dentist diagnose the gum diseases gingivitis and periodontitis. They also can reveal receding gums, exposed roots, tooth grinding (bruxism) and other problems.
									</p>
								</div>
							</li>
							<li>
								<div class="secondaryServices">
									<h3>Care for Sensitive Teeth</h3>
									<p>
										When you have sensitive teeth, certain activities, such as brushing, flossing, eating and drinking, can cause sharp, temporary pain in your teeth. Sensitive teeth are typically the result of worn tooth enamel or exposed tooth roots. Sometimes, however, tooth discomfort is caused by other factors, such as a cavity, a cracked or chipped tooth, a recently placed filling or a side effect of other dental procedures, such as bleaching.

									<h3>Restorative Dentistry</h3>
									<div>
										<p>
											Restorative dentistry is the study, diagnosis and integrated management of diseases of the teeth and their supporting structures.
										</p>
										<ul>
											<li>
												Fillings
											</li>
											<li>
												Crowns
											</li>

												Extraction
											</li>
										</ul>
									</div>
								</div>
							</li>
							<li>
								<div class="secondaryServices">
									<h3>Fillings</h3>
									<p>
										To treat a cavity your dentist will remove the decayed portion of the tooth and then "fill" the area on the tooth where the decayed material was removed.
										Fillings are also used to repair cracked or broken teeth and teeth that have been worn down from misuse (such as from nail-biting or tooth grinding).
									</p>
								</div>
							</li>
							<li>
								<div class="secondaryServices">
									<h3>Crowns</h3>
									<p>
										A crown can help strengthen a tooth with a large filling when there isn&#146;t enough tooth remaining to hold the filling. Crowns can also be used to attach bridges, protect a weak tooth from breaking or restore one that&#146;s already broken. A crown is a good way to cover teeth that are discolored or badly shaped. It&#146;s also used to cover a dental implant.
									</p>
								</div>
							</li>
							<li>
								<div class="secondaryServices">
									<h3>Dentures</h3>
									<p>
										A denture is a removable replacement for missing teeth and surrounding tissues. Two types of dentures are available -- complete and partial dentures. Complete dentures are used when all the teeth are missing, while partial dentures are used when some natural teeth remain.
									</p>
								</div>
							</li>
							<li>
								<div class="secondaryServices">
									<h3>Bridges</h3>
									<p>
										Dental bridges literally bridge the gap created by one or more missing teeth.
										A bridge is made up of two or more crowns for the teeth on either side of the gap -- these two or more anchoring teeth are called abutment teeth -- and a false tooth/teeth in between. These false teeth are called pontics and can be made from gold, alloys, porcelain, or a combination of these materials. Dental bridges are supported by natural teeth or implants.
									</p>
								</div>
							</li>
							<li>
								<div class="secondaryServices">
									<h3>Extraction</h3>
									<p>
										An extraction means to have a tooth removed, usually because of disease, trauma or crowding.
										If you need an extraction, your dentist will first numb the area to lessen any discomfort. After the extraction, your dentist will advise you of what post extraction regimen to follow. In most cases a small amount of bleeding is normal. Your mouth will slowly fill in the bone where the tooth root was through the formation of a blood clot.

									<h3>Professional Teeth Whitening</h3>
									<p>
										We offer three kinds of bleaching that will brighten your smile. Stains and discoloration caused by coffee, cigarettes, medication, or aging, will disappear.

										We have universal trays and customs trays.

										Want immediate results? We also provide in-office concentrated solution for immediate 1 hour results. We use the latest approved whitening agents for your comfort to achieve the results you expect.

									<h3>Smile Enhancement</h3>
									<p>
										A smile makeover is the process of improving the appearance of the smile through one or more cosmetic dentistry procedures, such as dental veneers, composite bonding, tooth implants and teeth whitening.
									</p>
								</div>
							</li>
							<li>
								<div class="secondaryServices">
									<h3>Fillings</h3>
									<p>
										To treat a cavity your dentist will remove the decayed portion of the tooth and then "fill" the area on the tooth where the decayed material was removed.
										Fillings are also used to repair cracked or broken teeth and teeth that have been worn down from misuse (such as from nail-biting or tooth grinding).

								</div>
							</li>
							<li>
								<div class="secondaryServices">
									<h3>Porcelain Veneers</h3>
									<p>
										Porcelain veneers are thin pieces of porcelain used to recreate the natural look of teeth, while also providing strength and resilience comparable to natural tooth enamel. It is often the material of choice for those looking to make slight position alterations, or to change tooth shape, size, and/or color.
									</p>
								</div>
							</li>
							<li>
								<div class="secondaryServices">
									<h3>Bonding</h3>
									<p>
										Tooth bonding is the application of a tooth-colored resin material using adhesives and a high intensity curing light. The procedure gets its name because materials are bonded to the tooth. Bonding is typically used for cosmetic purposes to improve the appearance of a discolored or chipped tooth.

									<h3>Emergency and Disease Dentistry</h3>
									<div>
										<p>
											Dental emergency is a broad, umbrella term used to describe an issue involving the teeth and supporting tissues that is of high importance to be fixed/treated by the relevant professional.

									<h3>Endodontics</h3>
									<p>
										Endodontics (from the Greek roots endo- "inside" and odont- "tooth") is the dental specialty concerned with the study and treatment of the dental pulp. Endodontists perform a variety of procedures including endodontic therapy (commonly known as "root canal therapy"), endodontic retreatment, surgery, treating cracked teeth, and treating dental trauma.
									</p>
								</div>
							</li>
							<li>
								<div class="secondaryServices">
									<h3>Periodontics</h3>
									<p>
										A periodontist is a dentist who specializes in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of periodontal disease, and in the placement of dental implants. Periodontists are also experts in the treatment of oral inflammation. Periodontists receive extensive training in these areas, including three additional years of education beyond dental school.
									</p>
								</div>
							</li>
							<li>
								<div class="secondaryServices">
									<h3>Gingivitis Treatment (Gum Disease)</h3>
									<p>
										Gingivitis, also generally called gum disease or periodontal disease, begins with bacterial growth in your mouth and may end -- if not properly treated -- with tooth loss due to destruction of the tissue that surrounds your teeth.
