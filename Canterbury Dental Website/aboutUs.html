									<h3>Dental Health is Physical Health</h3>
									<p>
										Our team of health care professionals believes that healthy gums, fresh breath, and strong teeth will brighten your smile. And a beautiful smile is good for your emotional and physical health. Once upon a time, dental care was avoiding a toothache. 
										But today we know that maintaining oral health is part of maintaining overall health. It reflects how you feel about yourself and affects how others view you. Your smile is the first impression you make as you meet someone new. And there are no second chances at a first impression.
